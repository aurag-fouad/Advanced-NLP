These samples are **likely not related to sustainability**, as they are selected randomly from the general dataset after removing rows that we extracted earlier.\n","\n","3. **Training and Testing Dataset**:\n","   - The extracted **493 sustainability-related tweets** will be used **exclusively for testing**.\n","   - The **3,000 rows** selected earlier, which are **probably unrelated to sustainability**, will be used for **training the sentiment analysis model**.\n","\n","# Summary\n","\n","- **Training Data**: 3,000 tweets from Sentiment140 (randomly selected, likely not related to sustainability).\n","- **Testing Data**: 493 tweets filtered from the Sentiment140 dataset that are **explicitly related to sustainability**.\n","\n","This approach ensures that the model is trained on general tweets but evaluated on a more specific domain (sustainability-related tweets)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"bb5fa4bd","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":16711,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728047784461,"user":{"displayName":"fouad auragh","userId":"02299450556867775483"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"bb5fa4bd","outputId":"b86dbd9b-2f62-4655-f13e-f658f2922ab4"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"dataframe","variable_name":"df"},"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-1715f8b4-47c6-4d44-aba2-209605bfc556\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>target</th>\n","      <th>ids</th>\n","      <th>date</th>\n","      <th>flag</th>\n","      <th>user</th>\n","      <th>text</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1467810369</td>\n","      <td>Mon Apr 06 22:19:45 PDT 2009</td>\n","      <td>NO_QUERY</td>\n","      <td>_TheSpecialOne_</td>\n","      <td>@switchfoot http://twitpic.com/2y1zl - Awww, t...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1467810672</td>\n","      <td>Mon Apr 06 22:19:49 PDT 2009</td>\n","      <td>NO_QUERY</td>\n","      <td>scotthamilton</td>\n","      <td>is upset that he can't update his Facebook by ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1467810917</td>\n","      <td>Mon Apr 06 22:19:53 PDT 2009</td>\n","      <td>NO_QUERY</td>\n","      <td>mattycus</td>\n","      <td>@Kenichan I dived many times for the ball.
