The objective was to generate concise summaries of longer texts and evaluate the quality of the summaries against human-written versions. The fine-tuned model demonstrated its potential for effective text summarization in this domain. Contribution for this task involves developing a custom preprocessing function to extract the model output and then evaluate it against human-writen summarizations using metrics like BLUE and ROUGE."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"dblH0GTWMYYg","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2236,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728081347050,"user":{"displayName":"Arag Foad","userId":"02730056572640568252"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"dblH0GTWMYYg","outputId":"df259ab1-b5ed-44c6-cbae-fdc87626a5e3"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"dpZL5kpQMYV2","metadata":{"id":"dpZL5kpQMYV2"},"outputs":[],"source":["%%capture\n","!pip install unsloth\n","# Also get the latest nightly Unsloth!\n","!pip uninstall unsloth -y && pip install --upgrade --no-cache-dir \"unsloth[colab-new] @ git+https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth.git\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6xLLLO9TMyY9","metadata":{"id":"6xLLLO9TMyY9"},"source":["# Let's read the dataset"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"0aa2c2a8","metadata":{"id":"0aa2c2a8"},"outputs":[],"source":["import os\n","import pandas as pd\n","\n","# Define the path to the dataset folders\n","articles_folder = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Advanced NLP/Dataset/business_articles'\n","summaries_folder = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Advanced NLP/Dataset/business_summaries'"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"b1e67102","metadata":{"id":"b1e67102"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Function to load text files from a folder into a list\n","def load_text_files(folder):\n","    texts = []\n","    filenames = sorted(os.listdir(folder))  # Sort to ensure matching order\n","    for filename in filenames:\n","        file_path = os.path.join(folder, filename)\n","        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:\n","            texts.append(file.read().strip())\n","    return texts"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"36592ad5","metadata":{"id":"36592ad5"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Load articles and summaries\n","articles = load_text_files(articles_folder)\n","summaries = load_text_files(summaries_folder)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"f98c8fb6","metadata":{"id":"f98c8fb6"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Create a DataFrame with articles and summaries\n","df = pd.DataFrame({\n","    'article': articles,\n","    'human_summary': summaries\n","})"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"_Hm2eiZrM3iW","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":12,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728081389856,"user":{"displayName":"Arag Foad","userId":"02730056572640568252"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"_Hm2eiZrM3iW","outputId":"799b3c58-66cf-4d0e-cab8-6fe6f84ad963"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"summary":"{\n  \"name\": \"df\",\n  \"rows\": 510,\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\n      \"column\": \"article\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 503,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Arsenal 'may seek full share listing'\\n\\nArsenal vice-chairman David Dein has said the club may consider seeking a full listing for its shares on the London Stock Exchange.\\n\\nSpeaking at the Soccerex football business forum in Dubai, he said a full listing was \\\"one of the options\\\" for funding after the club moves to its new stadium. The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.\\n\\nWhen Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time. The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing. \\\"When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,\\\" Mr Dein said.\\n\\n\\\"Listing would be one option, but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet. \\\"We want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing), Manchester United have been a success.\\\"\\n\\nMr Dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown. Since the formation of the Premier League in season 1992/93, Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar. \\\"Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition. \\\"We must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline, and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on TV too. \\\"I think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes I think less is more.\\\"\\n\\nThe club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium. It is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets, including Asia. \\\"We have two executives travelling round Japan and China at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs, and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too, as they are around the world. \\\"We have got a very good product, so it is very important we go and look at these markets, and make sure we are on the case.\\\"\",\n          \"Turkey-Iran mobile deal 'at risk'\\n\\nTurkey's investment in Iran's mobile industry looks set to be scrapped after its biggest mobile firm saw its investment there slashed by MPs.\\n\\nIran's parliament voted by a large majority to cut Turkcell's stake in a new mobile network from 70% to 49%. The move, which was justified on national security grounds, follows an earlier vote by MPs to give themselves a veto over foreign investments. Turkcell said the decision \\\"increases the risks\\\" attached to the project. Although the company's statement said it would continue to monitor developments, observers said they thought Turkcell was set to pull out of the $3bn deal. \\\"The possibility of carrying out this project is next to zero,\\\" said Atinc Ozkan, analyst at Finans Investment in Istanbul. If Turkcell does back out, MTN - the South African firm which lost out in the original tender - may well be back in the running. The company has said it is prepared to accept a minority stake if Iran will award it the mobile deal.\\n\\nTurkcell's mobile deal is the second Turkish investment in Iran to run into trouble. Turkish-Austrian consortium TAV was chosen to build and run Tehran's new Imam Khomeini International Airport - but the army closed it just hours after it opened in May 2004. In both cases, the justification has been national security, amid allegations that the Turkish firms are too close to Israel. The hardline posture taken by parliament, which is dominated by religious conservatives, could yet impact other inward investments.\",\n          \"Steady job growth continues in US\\n\\nThe US created fewer jobs than expected in December, but analysts said that the dip in hiring was not enough to derail the world's biggest economy.\\n\\nAccording to Labor Department figures, 157,000 new jobs were added last month. That took 2004's total to 2.2 million, the best showing in five years. Job creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy. While worries still remain, the conditions are set for steady growth in 2005, analysts said. The unemployment rate stayed at 5.4% in December, and about 200,000 jobs will need to be created each month if that figure is to drop.\\n\\n\\\"It was a respectable report,\\\" said Michael Moran, analyst at Daiwa Securities.\\n\\n\\\"Payroll growth in December was a little lighter than the consensus forecast, but we had upward revisions to the prior two months and an increase in manufacturing employment.\\\" \\\"Manufacturing is a cyclical area of the economy and if it's showing job growth, it's a good indication that the economy is on a solid growth track.\\\" That means that the Federal Reserve is likely to continue its policy of raising interest rates. The Fed lifted borrowing costs five times last year to 2.25%, citing evidence the US economic recovery was becoming more robust.\\n\\nJob creation was one of last year's main concerns for the US economy, and proved to be a main topic of debate in the US presidential election. While demand for workers is far from booming, the conditions are set for steady growth. \\\"Overall, compared to the previous year it looks great, it just keeps going stronger and stronger and I expect that to be the case\\\" in 2005, said Kurt Karl, economist at Swiss Re in New York. Meanwhile, economists cautioned against reading too much into data from the Federal Reserve showing an unexpected $8.7bn drop in consumer debt in November. A fall in consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of all US economic activity, could help limit the extent of any future interest rate rises. But economists said there could be a number of reasons for a fall in the borrowing, which include credit cards and personal loans, while noting that such figures can vary on a month-to-month basis.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"human_summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 500,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"A lifetime Sunderland supporter and board director since 1984, Mr Murray agreed to buy BSkyB's 4.76% holding in the Wearside club on Tuesday -

The club - which is currently listed on the smaller Ofex share exchange - is due to move into its new 60,000-seater Emirates Stadium at Ashburton Grove for the start of the 2006/07 season. Mr Dein also warned the current level of TV coverage of the Premiership may be reaching saturation level, with signs that match attendances have been dropping off in the first few months of this season.\\n\\nWhen Arsenal moves to its new stadium it will see its proportion of turnover from media earnings drop from 52% this season to 34% in two years' time. The club is hoping to increase matchday earnings from 29% to 40% of turnover, and has not ruled out other money-earning means, including a full share listing. \\\"When the new stadium opens we will go through a thorough financial review,\\\" Mr Dein said.\\n\\n\\\"Listing would be one option, but we are flexible and no decisions have been made on that issue yet. \\\"We want to be in the best financial health - maybe clubs can do it (listing), Manchester United have been a success.\\\"\\n\\nMr Dein said that, although television money and coverage had driven the English game forward in the past 10 years, he feared there might now be too many games being shown. Since the formation of the Premier League in season 1992/93, Premiership clubs have seen their income from television soar. \\\"Television has been the driving force over the past 10 years... but we must constantly improve if we want to remain as the world's leading league competition. \\\"We must monitor the quality of the product and ensure attendances do not decline, and we must balance that with the quantity of exposure on TV too. \\\"I think we have practically reached saturation point... sometimes I think less is more.\\\"\\n\\nThe club is funding its move to Ashburton Grove through a number of sources, including debt from banks, from money it already has and will receive in coming years from sponsors, and from the sale of surplus property, including its Highbury Stadium. It is also looking to create new revenue streams from overseas markets, including Asia. \\\"We have two executives travelling round Japan and China at the moment building relationships with organisations and clubs, and we know our supporters clubs are growing there too, as they are around the world. \\\"We have got a very good product, so it is very important we go and look at these markets, and make sure we are on the case.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"output\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 500,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"A lifetime Sunderland supporter and board director since 1984, Mr Murray agreed to buy BSkyB's 4.76% holding in the Wearside club on Tuesday -

Tightly packed populations in the areas involved in natural and man-made disasters were to partly to blame for the rise in claims, it said. Some 95% of insurance claims were for natural catastrophes, with the rest attributed to made-made events.\\n\\nThe largest claims came from the US, which was struck by four hurricanes, and Japan, which suffered the highest concentration of typhoons for decades plus a major earthquake.\\n\\nEurope suffered fewer natural disasters, but 191 people were killed and more than 2,000 injured in March after the terrorist attack on train stations in Madrid. The damages claimed in 2004 eclipsed previous years, including 2001 when the 11 September attacks pushed claims up to $37bn. Swiss Re said it had registered about 300 natural and man-made disasters around the world in 2004. Twenty-one thousand people lost their lives in the catastrophes with a cost to the global economy of around $105bn (£54bn).\\n\\n### Response:\\nSwiss Re said it had registered about 300 natural and man-made disasters around the world in 2004.The world\\'s second biggest insurer said disasters around the globe have seen property claims reach $42bn (£21.5bn).Tightly packed populations in the areas involved in natural and man-made disasters were to partly to blame for the rise in claims, it said.The damages claimed in 2004 eclipsed previous years, including 2001 when the 11 September attacks pushed claims up to $37bn.<|end_of_text|>'"]},"execution_count":36,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["train_dataset[\"text\"][0]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1Ro_eCzYtxY9","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":66,"referenced_widgets":["7c93c44de489489d9a3e68da15a29d41","8fb936486ae04926881a0fcea2acad56","4ff071b3db604a9fbe7be64994ed3d27","15aaf300c4c148a3a8f8d2e60a8a44b9","3811e446957e4b10bebacb9108f47a30","a8b5c7e5701c463fb4e63caace470f91","23129670f3aa4e698943ad32be945e65","87e4e889456c4db6b26aa183da6f078f","845ea38804074e70b293e6f702b99cbd","9fbc4e046a59447294c41547265f137d","f9610deeb5264306829f8749ec5bc9cf"]},"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-26T01:26:43.776149Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-26T01:26:43.775790Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-26T01:26:46.047544Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-26T01:26:46.046583Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-26T01:26:43.776106Z"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5113,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728076324915,"user":{"displayName":"Arag Foad","userId":"02730056572640568252"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"1Ro_eCzYtxY9","outputId":"9ef9df68-d7c6-458f-e23d-316c3999d65e"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"model_id":"7c93c44de489489d9a3e68da15a29d41","version_major":2,"version_minor":0},"text/plain":["Map (num_proc=2):   0%|          | 0/408 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["max_steps is given, it will override any value given in num_train_epochs\n"]}],"source":["from trl import SFTTrainer\n","from transformers import TrainingArguments\n","from unsloth import is_bfloat16_supported\n","\n","trainer = SFTTrainer(\n","    model = model,\n","    tokenizer = tokenizer,\n","    train_dataset = train_dataset,\n","    dataset_text_field = \"text\",\n","    max_seq_length = max_seq_length,\n","    dataset_num_proc = 2,\n","    args = TrainingArguments(\n","        per_device_train_batch_size = 2,\n","        gradient_accumulation_steps = 4,\n","        warmup_steps = 5,\n","        max_steps = 250,\n","        learning_rate = 2e-4,\n","        fp16 = not is_bfloat16_supported(),\n","        bf16 = is_bfloat16_supported(),\n","        logging_steps = 100,\n","        optim = \"adamw_8bit\",\n","        weight_decay = 0.01,\n","        lr_scheduler_type = \"linear\",\n","        seed = 3407,\n","        output_dir = \"outputs\",\n","    ),\n",")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"t6h7J_-LtxY-","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":225},"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-08-26T01:26:46.049404Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-08-26T01:26:46.049076Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-08-26T03:47:05.382205Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-08-26T03:47:05.381324Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-08-26T01:26:46.049365Z"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4745390,"status":"ok","timestamp":1728081070299,"user":{"displayName":"Arag Foad","userId":"02730056572640568252"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"t6h7J_-LtxY-","outputId":"8493b04c-a6b0-4b62-cfee-7d750ad974bb"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["==((====))==  Unsloth - 2x faster free finetuning | Num GPUs = 1\n","   \\\\   /|    Num examples = 408 | Num Epochs = 5\n","O^O/ \\_/ \\    Batch size per device = 2 | Gradient Accumulation steps = 4\n","\\        /    Total batch size = 8 | Total steps = 250\n"," \"-____-\"     Number of trainable parameters = 41,943,040\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","    <div>\n","      \n","      <progress value='250' max='250' style='width:300px;

Answer with the summary without any explanation.\\n\\n### Input:\\nChristmas sales worst since 1981\\n\\nUK retail sales fell in December, failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst Christmas since 1981.\\n\\nRetail sales dropped by 1% on the month in December, after a 0.6% rise in November, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The ONS revised the annual 2004 rate of growth down from the 5.9% estimated in November to 3.2%. A number of retailers have already reported poor figures for December. Clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth, according to the ONS.\\n\\nThe last time retailers endured a tougher Christmas was 23 years previously, when sales plunged 1.7%.\\n\\nThe ONS echoed an earlier caution from Bank of England governor Mervyn King not to read too much into the poor December figures. Some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures, pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figures showed a performance comparable with 2003. The November-December jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages, although some way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s. And figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending, an indication that consumers are looking for bargains, and retailers are cutting their prices.\\n\\nHowever, reports from some High Street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector. Morrisons, Woolworths, House of Fraser, Marks & Spencer and Big Food all said that the festive period was disappointing.\\n\\nAnd a British Retail Consortium survey found that Christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years. Yet, other retailers - including HMV, Monsoon, Jessops, Body Shop and Tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year. Investec chief economist Philip Shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates. \"The retail sales figures are very weak, but as Bank of England governor Mervyn King indicated last night, you don\\'t really get an accurate impression of Christmas trading until about Easter,\" said Mr Shaw. \"Our view is the Bank of England will keep its powder dry and wait to see the big picture.\"\\n\\n### Response:\\nInvestec chief economist Philip Shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates.The ONS
